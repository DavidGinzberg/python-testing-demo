# Python Testing Demo and Workspace

This repo is a collection of demos about python testing, and prompts to practice test driven development

The red-green-refactor approach is recommended. To that end, there is a set of branches named `red`, `green`, and `refactor`.
As you're working through this, start by checking out the `red` branch, and implementing the tests based on markdown files describing requirements
(stubs may or may not be provided already, and the requirements will usually mention that).  
Once you're happy with the tests you've written, you can continue by implementing the code being tested, or check out the `green` branch if you're stuck, and
begin implementing there.

Then, check out the `refactor` branch and you'll find sub-optimal implementations that either have bugs in skipped tests
or new requirements that require refactoring. Practice writing the test before implementing the change so you know whether you've implemented the feature correctly.
Look for a markdown file with a prompt for each refactoring practice.
